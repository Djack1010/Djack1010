I am a **research fellow** at the Institute of Informatics and Telematics (IIT) of the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa, and also a **PhD student** at the Computer Science Department of the University of Pisa.

My field of research is the **Cybersecurity**, and my research interests include Software Testing, Malware Analysis, Formal Methods and Machine Learning applied to cybersecurity problems, and Explainable AI.
